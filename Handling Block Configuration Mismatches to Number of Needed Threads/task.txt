The program in configloop.cu allocates memory, using cudaMallocManaged for a 1000 element array of integers, 
and then seeks to initialize all the values of the array in parallel using a CUDA kernel. 
This program assumes that both N and the number of threads_per_block are known. 
The task is to complete the following two objectives:

Assign a value to number_of_blocks that will make sure there are at least as many threads as there are elements in a to work on.
Update the initializeElementsTo kernel to make sure that it does not attempt to work on data elements that are out of range.
